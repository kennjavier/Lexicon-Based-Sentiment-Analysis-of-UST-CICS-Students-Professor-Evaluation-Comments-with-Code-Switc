# Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis of UST-CICS Students' Professor Evaluation Comments with Code Switching using Naive Bayes Algorithm and Support Vector Machines
## Abstract
Feedback is essential in any organization and institution. With this, sentiment analysis is
a useful tool in evaluating large quantities of textual feedback such as faculty evaluation
comments. This study provides an approach that evaluates the comments of UST-CICS students
and classifies whether the sentiment is either positive, negative, or neutral by using a
combination of a lexicon-based approach, a code switching detection module, and hybrid
machine learning models. The English lexicon, SentiWordNet 3.0, and the Filipino lexicon,
FilCon, were used to generate the initial sentiment classifications to be used on the Naive Bayes
and Support Vector Machine hybrid models. Furthermore, Taglish comments were processed
through a Code-Switching Point Detection Module which separates the English and non-English
words that are then processed using the appropriate lexicons. Overall, the lexicon module
achieved an overall accuracy of 55%. The hybrid model, Naive Bayes before Support Vector
Machines, was able to achieve accuracies of 55% overall, 58% in classifying English comments,
46% in Filipino comments, and 57% in Taglish comments. On the other hand, Support Vector
Machines before Naive Bayes, was able to achieve accuracies of 61% overall, 70% for English,
54% for Filipino, and 54% for Taglish.
